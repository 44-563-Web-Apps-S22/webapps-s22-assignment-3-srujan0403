I am from Hyderabad, India.
I love listening to music and read novels. 


<h2>Tamasha</h2>
<p>
    It is a hindi language film. They say cinema is subjective, they say and the statement holds true for Tamasha.
    On the surface, Tamasha is a love story, told in a non-linear narrative where a woman helps a man discover who he truly is.
